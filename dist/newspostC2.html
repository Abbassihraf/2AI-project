<p class="news__title">5 ways for publishers to<br>
survive in a world of higher<br>
content consumption</p>

<p class="news__txt">If you’ve experienced an increase in organic traffic over the past few<br>
weeks as the country reels over the shutdowns and related impact on<br>
their lives, you’re not alone. As more people are isolated from others and<br>
their traditional routines, it seems, they are increasingly turning to the<br>
internet as a source of both information and connection. Publishers are<br>
closely watching this and other digital media trends.</p>

<h1 class="titr">Content demand skyrockets…</h1>
<p class="news__txt">According to Nieman Lab, “March 12 was the day that several publishers<br>
saw a spike in online pageviews. That was the day after Donald Trump’s<br>
Oval Office address, the NBA suspending its season, and Tom Hanks<br>
coming down with the virus—all in about an hour’s time. It was also the<br>
day the NCAA canceled March Madness and the Dow had its biggest</p>

<h1 class="titr">…While ad spend tanks</h1>
<p class="news__txt">ABusinesses are dealing with a new normal. One that is not likely to shift<br>
anytime soon, and one that publishers must learn to navigate as<br>
current trends in media and entertainment sectors shift. These shifts<br>
require publishers to shift their strategies as well. Here are five ways you<br>
can navigate this new terrain while simultaneously meeting audience</p>

<h1 class="titr2">1. Find your niche.</h1>
<p class="news__txt">In mid-March, some of the top-trending queries in the US included<br>
“coronavirus USA,” “symptoms of coronavirus,” “coronavirus news,” and<br>

Sortable. While it’s important to tread carefully when it comes to<br>
newsjacking during the coronavirus pandemic, publishers certainly can<br>
and should consider ways that they can provide valued, and valuable,</p>

<h1 class="titr2">2. Increase organic traffic by shifting or renewing your focus.</h1>
<p class="news__txt">While ad buys and ad engagement may be seeing lower levels now<br>
than in the not-so-distant past, organic traffic is on the rise – especially<br>
on mobile, where the majority of people (55%) are getting their news<br>
from right now. </p>

<p class="news__txt ">Wibbitz has seen an increase in organic traffic over the past few weeks,<br>
for example, by 20% – now representing 56% of our overall site traffic.<br>
Take this as an opportunity to build your organic audience by investing<br>
time in SEO and optimizing evergreen content with video. </p>
