weeks as the country reels over the shutdowns and related impact on<br>
their lives, you’re not alone. As more people are isolated from others and<br>
their traditional routines, it seems, they are increasingly turning to the<br>
internet as a source of both information and connection. Publishers are<br>
closely watching this and other digital media trends.</p>

<h1 class="titr">Content demand skyrockets…</h1>
<p class="news__txt">According to Nieman Lab, “March 12 was the day that several publishers<br>
saw a spike in online pageviews. That was the day after Donald Trump’s<br>

<h1 class="titr2">2. Increase organic traffic by shifting or renewing your focus.</h1>
<p class="news__txt">While ad buys and ad engagement may be seeing lower levels now<br>

on mobile, where the majority of people (55%) are getting their news<br>
from right now. </p>

<p class="news__lasttxt">Wibbitz has seen an increase in organic traffic over the past few weeks,<br>
for example, by 20% – now representing 56% of our overall site traffic.<br>
Take this as an opportunity to build your organic audience by investing<br>
time in SEO and optimizing evergreen content with video. </p>
