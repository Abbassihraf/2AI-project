<p class="newspostC2__content">If you’ve experienced an increase in organic traffic over the past few weeks as the country reels over the shutdowns and related impact on their lives, you’re not alone. As more people are isolated from others and their traditional routines, it seems, they are increasingly turning to the internet as a source of both information and connection. Publishers are closely watching this and other digital media trends.
    Content demand skyrockets…
    According to Nieman Lab, “March 12 was the day that several publishers saw a spike in online pageviews. That was the day after Donald Trump’s Oval Office address, the NBA suspending its season, and Tom Hanks coming down with the virus—all in about an hour’s time. It was also the day the NCAA canceled March Madness and the Dow had its biggest point loss ever.”
    In mid-March, some of the top-trending queries in the US included “coronavirus USA,” “symptoms of coronavirus,” “coronavirus news,” and other coronavirus related search terms and phrases, according to Sortable. While it’s important to tread carefully when it comes to newsjacking during the coronavirus pandemic, publishers certainly can and should consider ways that they can provide valued, and valuable, coronavirus-related information to their audiences.
    While ad buys and ad engagement may be seeing lower levels now than in the not-so-distant past, organic traffic is on the rise – especially on mobile, where the majority of people (55%) are getting their news from right now. 

Wibbitz has seen an increase in organic traffic over the past few weeks, for example, by 20% – now representing 56% of our overall site traffic. Take this as an opportunity to build your organic audience by investing time in SEO and optimizing evergreen content with video.
